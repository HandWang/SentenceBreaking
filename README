Simple application for sentence boundary disambiguation.

Main idea:
File 'separators' contains all valid separators. File 'filters' 
contains filters, defining what is not a sentence bound. 
Application reads input.txt file and shows all bounds.


File 'separators' structure:
Each line in file is a regular expression, which defines valid 
separators. More compound separators must come earlier.
( For example, '?!' is more compound than '?' or '!' )

File 'filters' structure:
Each line in file is a regular expression, which defines what is 
not a sentence bound. 

Regular expression syntax:
