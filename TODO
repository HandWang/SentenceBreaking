    Refactoring:
     - merge (if it has sense) 'containsIndex' and 'containsAnyIndexFromRange'
     - think about 'getSepByRange' and 'getSepByIndex' (getting validity only instead of object)

    Regural expressions:
     - add more separators
     - add more filters
     
    Other:
     - find arduous input text
     -
